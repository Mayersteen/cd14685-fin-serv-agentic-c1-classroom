The transactions were conducted in rapid succession, with amounts deliberately kept below the $10,000 reporting threshold, indicative of structuring. The transactions were conducted via ATM at various branches, including Branch_Downtown_Main, Branch_Westside_Plaza, and Branch_Northgate_Mall. This activity appears to be structured to evade BSA/AML reporting requirements.",
